This is my study note of Rust language. I want to practice my English, so I decide to complete this chapter by English. If I have unclear expression in somewhere, please report it to me or submit a PRs on Github.

The purpose of these blogs is sharing my views on Rust design, syntax and some project implemnted with Rust. If you are encountering Rust for the first time, I recommend you read the official book of Rust language: [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/){target=blank_}.

Hope my blogs can give you different ideas about Rust.

To complete this chapter, I have referred to the following materials:

- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/){target=blank_}

- [Rust编程语言入门教程（Rust语言/Rust权威指南配套）【已完结】](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1hp4y1k7SV/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=0de771c86d90f02a6cab8152f6aa173f){target=blank_}
